# AutoScreenSettings
Change screen brightness and contrast at sunrise and sunset automatically. This might help you to sleep better, it does for me.

##How to install
If you want to run it at boot, place it in your boot folder, to open that folder press win + r and put `shell:startup`. If you want to run it manually you can, but it wont run on boot.

##Settings
To open settings, after opening the jar, a tray icon will be created. Right click it and press settings, and settings will open.

##Compatibility
Only for windows devices and some displays don't allow changing these values from os, so these displays won't be supported. Also some displays don't allow to change all values and just allow changing brightness. For reference, I have two displays on my pc, both support brightness and just one supports contrast

##Report bugs
If you find a bug, probably a dialog with the error will be shown, if it is, screenshot it and post an issue. If it isn't shown, you'll have to open it through cmd and send that logs in an issue. If you can't or don't know how to do this you can just post and issue, but I might not be able to fix it
