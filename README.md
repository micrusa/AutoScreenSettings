# AutoScreenSettings
Change screen brightness, contrast and RGB values at sunrise and sunset automatically. This might help you to sleep better.

## How to install/Update
Just open latest jar file from releases, and it will ask to install/update app. It will be run at boot. If you want to uninstall you have to exit app through tray icon and remove %APPDATA%/AutoScreenSettings folder

## Settings
To open settings, after opening the jar, a tray icon will be created. Right click it and press settings, and settings will open.

## Compatibility
Only for windows devices and some displays don't allow changing these values from os, so these displays won't be supported. Also some displays don't allow to change all values and just allow changing brightness. For reference, I have two displays on my pc, both support brightness and just one supports contrast and RGB values

## Report bugs
If you find a bug, probably a dialog with the error will be shown, if it is, screenshot it and post an issue, else just post the issue and I'll try to fix it
